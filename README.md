# uber-ride-analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes Uber ride data to uncover trends and patterns related to ride purposes, distances, timings, and seasonal impacts. The findings provide insights into user behavior and preferences, offering a deeper understanding of ride usage dynamics.

## Key Insights
### Purpose of Rides:

Most rides are booked for business purposes, especially for meetings and meals/entertainment.
### Time of Booking:

Peak booking hours are between 10 AM and 5 PM, reflecting higher demand during work and leisure hours.
### Distance Insights:

Majority of rides cover short distances (0-20 miles), with the highest concentration at 4-5 miles.
Rides beyond 20 miles are negligible.
### Seasonal Trends:

Ride counts significantly drop in winter months (November to January), likely due to reduced mobility.
### Correlation Analysis:

A strong negative correlation exists between business and personal rides.
## Tools and Technologies
Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI

Dataset: Uber ride data

## Visualizations

## Conclusions
Uber rides are primarily used for short-distance business purposes.

Seasonal and time-based patterns significantly influence ride demand.

Data insights can aid Uber in optimizing ride services and marketing strategies.
